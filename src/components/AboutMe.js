      <div class="italic">
        My name is Avery, and I'm currently 15 years old as of this year.
        <div>
          I'm pretty lazy but I always try and force myself to not get so lazy
          so that I don't look like an idiot.
          <div>Getting rid of old habits is a hard thing to do.</div>
          <div>
            Sometimes I wished I can just talk to someone about how I feel and
            have them tell me what to do, but experiencing things you don't want
            to is all part of life.
            <div>
              I also have a weird obessions with random things over time, like
              chickens.
